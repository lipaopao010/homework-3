# password generator

In this project, I created a password generator using javascript.

In this application, the user can set up the length of password, and choose diffenrent types of charaters to be included in the password. Then the system will randomly generate a password accroding to the selected criteria.

By using javascript, this application is run in the browser which features a clean and responsive user interface. 

Some topics used in this project are listed as below:
*Code comments
*Variables
*Conditional statements
*Equality
*Logical, comparison, and ternary operators
*for loop
*Functions
*Alerts, prompts, and confirms.
